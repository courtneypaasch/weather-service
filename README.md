# Weather Service

The goal for this application was to create a program that will return the current weather and forecast for the next five days for any city that the user inputs. We also wanted to store previous searches and allow users to click back through them. We were able to do this by utilizing the OpenWeather API and ajax. 

APIs are enormously useful to developers because they allow you to piggyback off of the work of other developers without having to reinvent the wheel. The API provided us with all the data that we used for the application, we just had to target it and format it according to our needs.

Here is a screenshot of the functioning weather service:
